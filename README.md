# Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) - Weekend Assignment

This assignment aims to create a DAO for decision-making on several proposals for a platform with on-chain governance and transparency.

## Problem Statement

You are tasked with creating a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) for a platform that allows for on-chain governance and transparency. The DAO should be able to facilitate decision-making on several proposals related to the platform's development, operations, and governance. The DAO should also enable voting by token holders and ensure that the voting process is secure, transparent, and verifiable.

## Requirements:
- The DAO should be built on a blockchain platform that supports smart contracts like Ethereum or Binance Smart Chain or Polygon.

- The DAO should have a native token that represents ownership and voting rights in the DAO.

- The DAO should have a governance mechanism that enables token holders to propose, discuss, and vote on proposals related to the platform's development, operations, and governance.

- The governance mechanism should have a transparent and secure process for submitting, reviewing, and voting on proposals.

- The governance mechanism should allow for both on-chain and off-chain discussions on proposals.

- The DAO should have a transparent and auditable voting process that ensures that all token holders' votes are counted accurately.

- The DAO should have a clear process for implementing approved proposals and updating the platform's smart contracts and parameters.

- The DAO should have a clear mechanism for distributing rewards and incentives to token holders who actively participate in the governance process.

## Deliverables

1. Develop and deploy smart contracts for the DAO and the native token.

2. Implement a governance mechanism that allows for proposal submission, discussion, and voting.

3. Implement a secure and transparent voting process that ensures all token holders' votes are counted accurately.

4. Develop a front-end interface that allows token holders to interact with the DAO and participate in the governance process.

5. Develop a clear process for implementing approved proposals and updating the platform's smart contracts and parameters.

6. Develop a mechanism for distributing rewards and incentives to token holders who actively participate in the governance process.

7. Write detailed documentation for the smart contracts and governance mechanism, including how to interact with the DAO and participate in the governance process.

## Technologies Used
- Solidity: Smart contracts for on-chain governance.
- Hardhat: Development framework for Ethereum.
- Ether.js: JavaScript library for interacting with Ethereum nodes.
- Next-JS: For frontend

## Evaluation Criteria:

- Quality of smart contract design and implementation.

- Effectiveness of the governance mechanism in facilitating decision-making and enabling token holders to participate in the process.

- Transparency and security of the proposal submission, discussion, and voting processes.

- Quality of the front-end interface and user experience.

- Effectiveness of the process for implementing approved proposals and updating the platform's smart contracts and parameters.

- Effectiveness of the mechanism for distributing rewards and incentives to token holders who actively participate in the governance process.

- Quality of the documentation and instructions for interacting with the DAO and participating in the governance process.



*Note: The above requirements and evaluation criteria are not exhaustive and are open to discussion and refinement based on the specific needs of the platform and its stakeholders.*
